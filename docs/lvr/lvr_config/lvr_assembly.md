## Setup

Make sure you are grounded.  Visually inspect the LVR for any damage.  You will need the following items:

LVR

LVR Baseplate

Wedge Locks

8mm flat head (not countersunk) M2.5 screws

M2.5 washers

5mm M2 screws

Thermal gap filler strips

Thermal paste (GL-20-10 for now)

Kapton Tape 

Punch

Screwdrivers

## Wedge Locks

It is not clear to me if Kapton tape is needed to prevent the wedge lock from abrading the solder mask, so I include the step for now.
Put a strip of kapton along the edges of the CCM side of the board.  Poke holes for the wedge lock screws with a punch.  Attach the wedgelocks (IMPORTANT: The side that can be adjusted with an alan key needs to face the LVR outputs (two big connectors)).  Attach each wedgelock with 2 M2 screws.
Note:  I put the wedge locks on last.  It should be much easier to do them first, but I don't have any pictures.

## Thermal gap filler

Remove one side of the plastic backing and press the gap filler strip on to the exposed metal on the LHC4913 side of the board, aligning the screw holes.  Then remove the plastic backing from the other side.  Repeat for the other side of the board.

Put the applicator on an LHC4913 chip, gently push the plunger, and spread some paste on the chip.  Only the metal heat sink needs to be covered.  See attached picture for approximate thickness.  Repeat for all 10 chips.  

## Baseplate

Place the baseplate on the LHC4913 side of the LVR.  Make sure the baseplate is aligned so that the raised squares with threaded holes match the holes on the LVR.  Also check that all corners are aligned.

Put an M2.5 screw and washer in each hole.  First tighten very gently, then make hand tight in an X pattern across the board.  Try to look between the LVR and baseplate to see that the thermal paste has made contact with the baseplate and been deformed.  Not all chips can be verified this way.

Update the database, you have assembled an LVR!
