LVR Baseplate

Wedge Locks

8mm flat head (not countersunk) M2.5 screws

M2.5 washers

5mm M2 screws

Thermal gap filler strips

Thermal paste (GL-20-10 for now)

Kapton Tape 

Punch

Screwdrivers

## Wedge Locks

It is not clear to me if Kapton tape is needed to prevent the wedge lock from abrading the solder mask, so I include the step for now.
Put a strip of kapton along the edges of the CCM side of the board.  Poke holes for the wedge lock screws with a punch.  Attach the wedgelocks (IMPORTANT: The side that can be adjusted with an alan key needs to face the LVR outputs (two big connectors)).  Attach each wedgelock with 2 M2 screws.  

## Thermal gap filler

Remove one side of the plastic backing and press the gap filler strip on to the exposed metal on the LHC4913 side of the board, aligning the screw holes.  Then remove the plastic backing from the other side.  Repeat for the other side of the board.

Put the applicator on an LHC4913 chip, gently push the plunger, and spread some paste on the chip.  Only the metal heat sink needs to be covered.  See attached picture for approximate thickness.  Repeat for all 10 chips.
