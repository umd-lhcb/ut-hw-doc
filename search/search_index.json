The burn-in uses both hardware and software which were designed at UMD. The burn-in testing makes extensive use of the software in the repo NeoBurnIn . This repo also imports software from repo rpi.burnin . Hardware Configuration The hardware system has four major components, the MARATON power supply, the crate containing the LVRs, the crate containing the switching load boards, and a single raspberry pi. The MARATON power supply is connected to the crate containing the LVRs and is used to provide power to the separate LVR channels. The LVRs connect to the crate containing the switching load boards and have their output connected to the switching load boards. The switching load boards and the single raspberry pi are the parts of the hardware configuration that require the most setup so they will each receive their own section. A picture of the final hardware configuration is shown below. Switching Load Board Setup The switching load boards are used to increase the current output by the LVRs. A picture of the board is shown below. From the picture there are two separate connections which will have pinouts to other hardware. The two pinouts on the upper left-side of the board ( P101 ) are labeled as V Opto Sec. 5V . These pinouts are connected to a function generator which provides a 5V DC connection to the switching load board. The positive and negative terminals connect to the respective positve and negative terminals of the function generator. The second connection are the two pinouts on the upper right-side of the board ( P102 ) which are labeled as RPi GPIO Control . The positive terminal of this connection connects to one of the many GPIO pins on the raspberry pi and the negative terminal connects to one the the raspberry pi pins labeled GND . Any GPIO pins that occur on the pi at pins 11 or lower can not be conencted to the switching load boards as these GPIO pins are reserved for other hardware. This will be further explained in the section describing the raspberry pi hardware setup. Additionally, a python script was made which will pull the GPIO pin connected to the switching load board high for 60 seconds, then pull the pin low for 10 seconds and repeat this process until the user interrupts this process (from Ctrl+C). Pulling the GPIO pin high will power the switching load board and tell it to increase the current output by the LVRs. The python script will be described more with the other software below. Raspberry Pi Setup The single raspberry pi for the hardware is considered the brain of the system as this pi controls all of the software for the system and controls the power to the hardware. The raspberry pi for this system is version RPi 3B+ and has a MicroSD card configured to run the NixOS operating system (linux based). The pi must be connected to a monitor and keyboard in order to control the system. Note: The grounding for the pi is through the shield of the HDMI cord connecting the monitor to the pi. This means that the monitor conencted to the pi must have a three-prong power cord to ensure that all GNDs in the system are referencing the Earth GND. The raspberry pi controls most of the smaller hardware parts of the system including the USB relay (used to control the CP100 Rain Bird Solenoid Valve), the water alarm, the fire alarm and all of the thermistors. Note: The power for the thermistors and the fire alarm both come from the 3.3V pin of the pi although there is only one 3.3V pin. To fix this we made a wire which starts at the 3.3V pin of the pi and forks out to make two connections. UPDATE: There are actually two 3.3V pins on the raspberry pi, however the second 3.3V pin is not near the other power pins. Due to this, we decided to contiue use of the forked connection as it is best to keep all power connections in one place. A picture of all connections to the raspberry pi GPIO pins is shown below. USB Relay and Solenoid Valve The USB relay and solenoid valve control the water flowing to the LVR crate. This water is used for cooling the crate if it gets too hot. A diagram of the circuit is shown below. The USB relay in this diagram would be connected to the raspberry pi via USB. Multiple solenoid valves can be inserted into this system although now we only have one solenoid valve in use as each solenoid valve in the system requires its own diode and normally open (NO) terminal. Water Alarm The water alarm is used to measure if water is leaking on the floor next to the crate containing the LVRs. This would occur if the tubes connected to the solenoid valve started to leak. If water is detected then the software will output a WATER message. The water alarm is a floor water sensor by Level Sense . The water alarm has a red wire, which is connected to one of the 5V connections on the pi, and a white wire, which is connected to pin 11 of the pi ( GPIO17 ) with a pull-down resistor of 4.7k. Fire Alarm The fire alarm is used to detect if smoke is rising from the crate containing the LVRs. If smoke is detected then the alarm will trigger and the software will output a FIRE message. The fire alarm has three connections to the pi. The grey wire from the alarm will connect to one of the GND pins of the pi. The blue wire from the alarm has two connections with a pull-down resistor connecting them. The red only wire soldered to the blue wire is the power for the alarm and is connected to one of the forked 3.3V connections. The red wire with black markings soldered to the blue wire is the control for the alarm and is connected to pin 8 ( GPIO14 ) of the pi. Thermistors The thermistors are used to measure the temperature of the LVRs being burned-in. The thermistors have their values averaged to obtain the nominal temperature of the crate. If the crate has a temperature of 30C or higher then the solenoid valve is turned to allow water to flow to the crate and aid in cooling the crate. Once the crate has a temperature of 29C or lower then the solenoid valve is turned off and water flow stops to ensure that the crate does not continue to cool. The thermistors all have their GND legs soldered to their VDD legs and are connected in parallel to each other via a breakout board connected to the pi. The breakout board has one rail for the GND connection of each thermistor and one rail for the data obtained by the thermistor. A diagram of the circuit is shown below. The connections to the pins of the pi in the diagram are the same as the connections to the pins of the pi in use for the burn-in. Note It has been observed that the w1 devices (/sys/bus/w1/devices/) lost connections with the RPi after ~3 months' inactivity. If you see the error from CtrlClient.py No such file or directory: '/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-0000098d8197/w1_slave' or no temperature reading in logs/DataServer.log, try replugging the 3 GPIO connectors and the thermal sensor breakout board connectors. Software The software for the burn-in is all run through the raspberry pi and comes from the repo NeoBurnIn . Some software also comes from the rpi.burnin repo although the necessary software from this repo is downloaded from the command shown in the Dependencies section. In order to run to the burn-in software one must first clone the master branch of the NeoBurnIn repo. After cloning, change directory to the recently cloned NeoBurnIn repo and isuue the command: nix-shell This will setup the evironment for the software to be run correctly. Dependencies After setting up the environment, the required packages for the software must be downloaded. All required packages can be installed with: pip install -U -r ./requirements.txt Configuration The configuration of all data logging and hardware is included in the YAML files for each of the python scripts. These YAML are: - NeoBurnIn/DataServer.example.yml - NeoBurnIn/CtrlServer.example.yml - NeoBurnIn/measurements/test_temp_ctrl_client.yml NeoBurnIn/DataServer.example.yml controls the setup for the output log file from DataServer.py . This YAML file also controls the standard deviation range to use for the thermistor readout warning. NeoBurnIn/CtrlServer.example.yml controls the setup for the output log file from CtrlServer.py . This YAML file also controls the IP address and port number of the raspberry pi to be used for the curl commands which control the USB relay. Additionally, this YAML file controls the time intervals on which the USB relay and MARATON power supply can be controlled. For example, in this file if the variable minTimeOut is set to 60 then this means that the channels of the USB relay and the MARATON power supply can only be switched from on to off or vice-versa every 60 seconds. NeoBurnIn/measurements/test_temp_ctrl_client.yml controls the setup for the output log file from CtrlClient.py . This YAML file also controls the setup of the thermistors, the setup of the MARATON power supply and the setup of both alarms (these controls are under the label sensors ). Additionally, this YAML file controls the setup for the control commands of both the USB relay and the MARATON power supply (these controls are under the label controllers ). Note that the control for the USB relay in this YAML file is only the control from the thermistors but not the control from the curl commands. Also, this YAML file controls the rules for when to turn on/off the cooling from the solenoid valve (these controls are under the label ctrlRules ). Additionally, this YAML file can also control the rules for when to turn on/off the MARATON channels although this has not yet been implemented. These controls would also be implemented under the label ctrlRules . Usage To start the burn-in testing one must issue the command tmux and then open four separate panels using the key combination Ctrl+A, \" . One can open more panels if needed although four panels should be sufficient to run the burn-in. Note: In order to start the burn-in testing one must be in the directory of the recently cloned NeoBurnIn repo. If one is following the directions in this documentation then they should already be in the necessary directory. In the first panel, one will run DataServer.py using the command ./DataServer.py --config-file ./DataServer.example.yml In the second panel, one will run CtrlServer.py using the command ./CtrlServer.py --config-file ./CtrlServer.example.yml In the third panel, one will run CtrlClient.py using the command ./CtrlClient.py --config-file ./measurements/test_temp_ctrl_client.yml The fourth and final panel will be used for controlling the PSU (MARATON) and the USB relay with curl commands. If controlling the PSU and USB relay is not necessary then only three panels are necessary although it is best to have four panels just in case. Note: To navigate between tmux panels, type Ctrl+A, up/down arrow keys in order to move up/down between panels. To stop the burn-in testing, navigate to each tmux panel which is running and type Ctrl+C in order to issue a keyboard inturrupt which will stop the code from running. After all codes are stopped, one can exit tmux panels by issuing the command exit within each panel. Controlling the PSU (MARATON) with curl To control the PSU (MARATON) with curl , one must be running all three scripts as described in the Usage section and have a fourth tmux panel setup. In the fourth panel, one can turn on/off a MARATON channel using the commands curl -X POST http://192.168.1.30:45679/psu/192.168.1.31/<CHANNEL_NUMBER>/on curl -X POST http://192.168.1.30:45679/psu/192.168.1.31/<CHANNEL_NUMBER>/off where <CHANNEL_NUMBER> is the number of the MARATON channel which one would like to turn on/off. There are 12 MARATON channels that can be turned on/off, ranging from channel 1 to channel 12. If changing the MARATON channel on/off is successful then the terminal will output Success and the LEDs on the LVRs for that MARATON channel will turn on/off respectively. Before changing the state of a MARATON channel, one must ensure that the time period specified by minTimeOut has passed or else the command will not issue succesfully. For example, if the variable minTimeOut is set to 60 and one tries to turn off a MARATON channel 10 seconds after turning it on then the channel will not turn off. One must then wait an additional 50 seconds before issuing the command again for it to execute as expected. Note: If using the WEINER control software for a Windows machine it is important to note that the MARATON channels are numbered in a different way. The WEINER control software numbers the 12 MARATON channels by started at channel 0 and going to channel 11. This means that issuing the curl command to turn on channel 1 will turn on the channel labeled 0 on the WEINER control software. If one is not using the WEINER control software to monitor the MARATON channels then do not worry about this numbering offset. Controlling the USB Relay with curl To control the USB relay with curl , one must be running all three scripts as described in the Usage section and have a fourth tmux panel setup. In the fourth panel, one can turn on/off a USB relay channel using the commands curl -X POST http://192.168.1.30:45679/relay/0001:0014:00/<CHANNEL_NUMBER>/on curl -X POST http://192.168.1.30:45679/relay/0001:0014:00/<CHANNEL_NUMBER>/off where <CHANNEL_NUMBER> is the number of the USB relay channel which one would like to turn on/off. There are only two USB relay channels, channel 1 and channel 2, and only one channel will need to be turned on/off. This is because only one channel will be connected to a solenoid valve for the burn-in (as of 3/26/20). To see which channel one must turn on/off with curl commands one must inspect the hardware setup of the system, although the hardware should be setup such that the solenoid valve is connected to channel 2 of the USB relay. Again, one must wait for the minTimeOut time to pass before a successful turning on/off of the USB relay channel. After a successful turning on/off of a USB relay channel the terminal will output Success and the respective channel LED on the USB relay will turn on/off. Note: The number 0001:0014:00 in the curl commands can change and one should check if this number has changed before issuing these curl commands. To check whether this number has changed, issue the command curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:45679/relay/list as this command will list all of the device numbers for that USB port. There should only be one device listed which will be the USB relay.","title":"Burn-in system"},{"location":"burnin/burnin_doc/#intro","text":"The \"burn-in\" stage of testing is to ensure that the LVRs can be used in the final system at CERN.

Warning Make sure you are grounded at all times when handling the DCB! Look for scratches, gouges, and any other signs of obvious damage on the surface of the DCB. Inspect more thoroughly by focusing on 1 GBTx cluster at a time. All clusters should be the same and include the same components. If a piece appears to be missing, compare to the other groups. If they are all the same, it is likely correct Look for any pieces that are bent, broken, or otherwise askew within each cluster. Note Each GBTx has a marked corner which must match a white dot on the DCB. The black SCA also has marked corner and dot. Note There are also a couple small components, the ones next to pieces labeled \"R500\", with faint white lines on one side. That side also points to a white dot on the DCB The dots are on the top left in this example Now look at the 4 mezzanine connectors (the connectors inside the outline). Angle the DCB to see each pin clearly and confirm there are no globs of solder possibly connecting two pins. Also confirm that no pins are bent or broken. Next flip the DCB over so that you are looking at the bottom side of the DCB. Check the bottom side near the optical mezzanines to ensure that there are no extra globs of solder protruding through the surface of the DCB. Note If there are extra globs of solder present then it can short the DCB when assembled to the backplate. An example of the extra globs of solder is shown here Finally examine the large backplane connecter on the other end of the DCB. Look into the connector at the pins and make sure they are all uniform. A bent pin could break a backplane. Tilt the DCB to look between the board and the connector. It is attached by many small solder pads so must lay flat and straight. Any angle or disconnected pads should be noted. Install thermal gap filler on the DCB backplate There are pre-cut thermal fillers for the DCB backplate. Peel the film off and put it on, making sure that the pre-cut holes align with the holes of the DCB backplate. It is much easier to ensure the thermal gap filler is straight if two people work together. Warning Make sure that the thermal gap filler is placed on the flat side of the backplate. The backplate is not symmetrical. The thermal gap should be put on the side that doesn't have countersuck screw holes. Once the thermal gap filler looks straight then use a screw to take out any leftover thermal gap filler over the screw-holes that may have not been trimmed off. This will ensure that the backplate will connect smoothly to the DCB and that no residue from the thermal gap filler will attach to the DCB. Install the heat pipe on the DCB backplate To install the heat pipes: Put a thin line of thermal grease on the pipes using a spreader, not going all the way to the edges. The grease squeezes out when the pipes are installed and tightened. Use 10 M.3 countersunk bolts to secure the heat pipe to the backplate. Note that it is easiest to screw in opposite diagonal bolts first to fix the heat pipe. Wipe away excess grease along the sides of the heat pipe. Can use Isopropyl Alchohol to clean residue if needed (above 70% IPA). Repeat for the second heat pipe. Warning Pay attention to the direction of the heat pipe! The long end should point toward the flat side of the backplate and the short piping toward the notched side. Follow the pictures below for further guidance or if anything is not clear. Optical Mezzanines Each DCB needs 4 optical mezzanines, 3 with VTTxs and 1 with a VTRx . An assembled mezzanine will look like this, where the black component in a yellow casing is a VTTx. Note A VTTx is black while a VTRx is red . They both have a yellow casing and look the exact same otherwise. The VTT/Rxs have nubs on top that don't fit into the slot on the mezzanines. Take a pair of wire cutters and clip them off to be flush with the rest of the plastic casing. this can cause the holes to close over with plastic. Take a metal pick and carefully clear out the residual plastic to make a clean hole. Plug in a VTT/Rx and make sure the holes are aligned with the slot on the mezzanines front Screw in 2 M1.4 bolts to attach the mezzanine and the VTT/Rx, tighten gently. It can be really hard to get the tiny bolts to work. If you're having trouble, use tweezers to hold the bolt in place while putting a decent amount of force into the hole while you start to screw it in Repeat for 4 total mezzanines. Make sure one has a red VTRX while the rest have VTTxs Final assembly Note The final assembly is easiest with two people! For final assembly of the board: Use 16 M.2.5 countersunk bolts along with 16 long M.2.5 hexagonal nuts and Kapton washers (part# 5611-33-5) to install the DCB backplate onto the DCB and provide supports for the optical mezzanines. The bolts should be placed on the backplate side and should fit into the countersunk holes while the nuts and washers will sit on top of the DCB. Again fix opposite diagonal bolts first. Note This is for the flat edge/long pipe side of the assembly. Warning The nuts on top of the DCB should not be rotated as they will damage the surface of the DCB. In order to prevent this secure the nut using pliers or a socket wrench and use a screwdriver to tighten. Use 8 M.3 countersunk bolts along with 8 short M.3 hexagonal nuts and Kapton washers (part# 5611-130-5) to secure the notched side of the backplate. The washers should be placed on the DCB to protect it from the hex nut. Warning The nuts on top of the DCB should not be rotated as they will damage the surface of the DCB. In order to prevent this secure the nut using pliers or a socket wrench and use a screwdriver to tighten. Install jumpers to the board according to the picture, these are needed to configure the DCB. They should be oriented with their metal side away from the board Red Lines are where the jumpers go Note You should install 10 jumpers to the following connectors: J2 pins 1-3, 4-6 J4 pins 3-4 J10 pins 3-4, 5-6 J12 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 J13 1-3, 2-4 Continuity check Measure the resistance between any of the TP5 around the data GBTxs and the aluminum backplate. The resistance should be very large to ensure the backplate is not electronically connected to the DCB.","title":"DCB mechanical assembly"},{"location":"dcb/dcb_assembly/dcb_assembly/#visual-inspection-of-new-dcb","text":"Record serial number from sticker on the DCB to the database and put the next label on the board. Warning Make sure you are grounded at all times when handling the DCB! Look for scratches, gouges, and any other signs of obvious damage on the surface of the DCB. Inspect more thoroughly by focusing on 1 GBTx cluster at a time. All clusters should be the same and include the same components. If a piece appears to be missing, compare to the other groups. If they are all the same, it is likely correct Look for any pieces that are bent, broken, or otherwise askew within each cluster. Note Each GBTx has a marked corner which must match a white dot on the DCB. The black SCA also has marked corner and dot. Note There are also a couple small components, the ones next to pieces labeled \"R500\", with faint white lines on one side. That side also points to a white dot on the DCB The dots are on the top left in this example Now look at the 4 mezzanine connectors (the connectors inside the outline). Angle the DCB to see each pin clearly and confirm there are no globs of solder possibly connecting two pins. Also confirm that no pins are bent or broken. Next flip the DCB over so that you are looking at the bottom side of the DCB. Check the bottom side near the optical mezzanines to ensure that there are no extra globs of solder protruding through the surface of the DCB. Note If there are extra globs of solder present then it can short the DCB when assembled to the backplate. An example of the extra globs of solder is shown here Finally examine the large backplane connecter on the other end of the DCB.

Failing to do so could destroy the boards! The DCB has a few purposes; aggregating data, controlling the stave, and monitoring. It has 4 optical mezzanines with 3 VTTxs and 1 VTRx, as well as 1 master GBTx, 1 GBT-SCA, and 6 data GBTxs. The DCB talks to the stave through the Backplane connecter and a computer through the mezzanines. The PRBS test checks the DCB ability to get data from the GBTxs to the computer. A psuedo-random bit sequence, or PRBS, is generated in the data GBTxs and sent to our computer via the VTTxs. This test verifies the black data lines on the image. In the SALT test, we tell the stave what data to send to the DCB to check the grey data lines. Each line represents 12 E-links connecting the stave to the GBTxs. For our tests, we have the stave sending c4 repeated to the DCB. It is easy for this to get out of phase, which is why we accept any stable data in the memory monitor as a success. To see possible out-of-phase responses, you can break c4 into 8bit binary, shift it one bit left or right, then make it hex again. We check the DCB control of the stave by testing TFC loopback, where a GBTx sends a header of 04 to the stave. We know the E-links will be good as they have just been checked, so we expect to see the stave repeating 04 back to us if everything is working correctly. It is also fine here to see a bit-shift, making it look like the stave is repeating 01 , 02 , or 08 . There are also ADCs (analog to digital converters) we look at to verify the power and, for the ones attached to thermistors, monitor the temperature on the DCB itself and the stave. Note Make sure to keep the database up to date as you go through the tests. Fusing GBTx Warning If the DCB has already gone through the burn-in, skip fusing and go straight to \" Setting up DCB \" Verify the jumper on J2 , next to the optical mezzanines, looks like this There will already be an optical mezzanine connected to a dongle that you need to attach to the DCB. It goes over the outline with the label OMDBMC . Don't worry about screwing it in, this is a temporary setup. On the left of the picture is a different power breakout board that must also be attached. Its powered by two 1.5 volt connections with amp limit 2.5 and one 3.3 volt connection with amp limit 0.5, the power setup should look like the picture below. Power on the DCB. Open the GBTX Programmer on the windows PC. If it's not already open you can find it under D:/Users/DT_Rack/GBTx_Programmer as a jar file called programmerv2.20180725.jar . Check the connection is working by clicking Read GBTX , the state should change to pauseForConfig Go to the Fuse my GBTx tab all the way on the right click Import Image , make sure you can see .txt files, and select master.txt click Write GBTX then Read GBTX , the state should change to waitDESLock to the right of table, find and click update view. All of the entries in the table should now be green Now check enable fusing and fuse updateConfig , and click the big FUSE button at the bottom Note Register 365 should not be checked and fused. Shut off power to the DCB and move the right jumper on J2 up one to be in-line with the other jumper. To verify the fuse was successful, power the DCB back on. in the GBTX Programmer , read and update view like before. The table should still be all green Add a red jumper to connector J4 as shown Take off the mezzanine with the dongle and attach all 4 of the mezzanines that came with the DCB. Make sure the red VTRx mezzanine goes on the connector OMDBMC Setting up DCB Verify the backplane connector. Do not plug in if its pins are bent, as it can break the backplane. Verify optical mezzanines are attached. They should rest on the long hex nuts. Attach optical fibers to the mezzanines. Two fibers go into each board. They should be sequential except for the two attached fibers which go to the master. The order should be something like 1, 2, Masters, 3, 4, 5, 6 Correct slot based on stave connection will either be JD10 (for stave JP8 ) or JD11 (for stave JP11 ) Slide DCB into the proper slot using the heat spreader pipes as handles. Let it gently go down until until the guide rails at the bottom go in and the DCB sits correctly. Then push until it clicks in. Checking Power There are 3 separate power lines, for the DCB, the VTTx's, and the Stave. They should not be moved or changed over the course of this QA, but it is good to verify the connections are correct. DCB Power comes to pairs of boards as labeled by the slot they are put in. 0 and 1, 2 and 3, etc... A set of 8 cables are split into groups of 4 labeled DCB-A and DCB-B . The sets are broken down into two more sets of two; a master and slave (labeled M and S) which each have a source and return. A goes to the even board of a pair, slot JD10 , and B goes to the odd board, JD11 . It does not matter which wire gets the masters and which gets the slave SRC connects to the wire labeled 1v5 and RET connects to ground for all 4 pairs. VTTx There is a set of power and ground cables labeled 2v5 VTTX CH 3 and RET that we'll connect to a set of wires with a tag \"JD10/11\" The 2v5 VTTX cable connects to the wire labeled 2v5 and RET goes to ground. Stave There's P1, P2, P3, and P4 which each have SRC and RET . Make sure P1 SRC goes to P1 SRC and so on for all 8 wires. Note On the Linux computer, we'll use nanoDAQ which gives some MiniDAQ functions in Python. Go to $HOME/src/nanoDAQ in a command line on the server to use. Also open MiniDAQ by going to Applications , WinCC , Project Administrator , then double click on the top project. Programming Data GBTxs There are 6 data GBTxs on each DCB, and these must be programed every time the board gets power cycled. Note nanoDAQ has some documentation here . A pdf that goes over a lot of MiniDAQ and GBTx usage can be downloaded here . In the nanoDAQ command prompt, we're going to pull the reset, also called GPIO, low and try to program it then high and try to program it. First, enter ./dcbutil.py gpio --reset 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 --final_state low to pull all resets low. Then attempt to program the GBTxs with ./dcbutil.py init ./gbtx_config/slave-Tx-wrong_termination.txt -g 0 You should get an error Now do the reverse by changing --final_state to high to enter ./dcbutil.py gpio --reset 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 --final_state high You should now be able to program the GBTxs with the command you inputted earlier. PRBS Test Note This is the MiniDAQ \"Top\" panel that is referenced a couple times. Most menus can be found starting from this panel. To start PRBS, go to the nanoDAQ command line and enter ./dcbutil.py prbs on Open the PRBS panel by going to the top MiniDAQ hardware panel and clicking PRBS . In the top left of the panel, click in order: Stop All Generators \u2192 Stop All Checkers \u2192 Reset All Counters \u2192 Start All Generators \u2192 Start All Checkers \u2192 Start All Counters Allow test to run for 1-5 minutes . It passes if there are 6 green channels shown on the PRBS panel. The picture shows 6 red ones. These are the correct channels and should be green if everything passes There is a screen above the power switch that shows some readout values for the lvr. In the top left chunk, we care about the values of i_SENSE_MON3 , i_SENSE_MON4 , and i_SENSE_MON7 . Add the values from 3 and 4 together and record it on the database under \"1.5V current[A]\" Record the value from 7 on the database under \"2.5V current[A]\" Check if the DCB can regain lock by unplugging the master optical fibers then plugging them back in. Remember, master are the ones connected. Enter ./dcbutil.py prbs off in the nanoDAQ command line. No output is a success, otherwise it will report \"Master GBT not locked\" Warning Stop here if the DCB has NOT gone through the burn-in yet!!! SALT Testing The following three tests (SALT, TFC, and ADC) have different instructions dependant on the slot the DCB is connected to, which is determined by the stave connection. Each slot only tests half of the board. Remember JP8 goes to slot JD10 and JP11 goes to slot JD11 . Changing the stave connection is a process, so we'll test the same half on many boards, then swap everything to check the other half. Note Make sure to program the data GBTxs if the DCB has been powered off since doing so For this step, we need to open the Memory Monitoring panel in MiniDAQ. In the Top panel, double click DAQ to open a new window, then keep double clicking TELL40 until the following panel shows up, with the tab for Memory Monitoring on the right. Note The last TELL40 has a suffix, click on the first Dev1_0 In nanoDAQ , type in the command ./dcbutil.py gpio --reset 0 1 2 3 4 5 --final_state low Now type ./saltutil.py [I2C] read 0 0 1 replacing the [I2C] with 3 , 4 , and 5 if the DCB is in slot JD10 . Replace with 0 , 1 , 2 if the DCB is in slot JD11 You have to enter this command 3 times, once for each number. If it is working correctly you'll get an error. Then repeat the process but change the final state to high. You should get a result. ./dcbutil.py gpio --reset 0 1 2 3 4 5 --final_state high The following is for a DCB in slot JD10 only Start with ./saltutil.py 4 init for I2C 4 Type ./dcbutil.py init ~/bin/tmp_0.xml -s 1 to work with GBT 1 Go to the memory monitoring panel and select link 22 at the top Verify that Write Address Memory on the right changes values every couple seconds and Write Signal Status is green. Now look at the table, focusing on the latter 3 columns. There are 8 digits in each column. If they are NOT stable values, go to nanoDAQ and type ./dcbutil.py init ~/bin/tmp_1.xml -s 1 keep incrementing the tmp_*.xml until the values are a stable bit shift of c4 . Repeat this process starting with ./saltutil.py 3 init followed by ./dcbutil.py init ~/bin/tmp_0.xml -s 2 Link Selection must be on 12 now When incrementing tmp_*.xml keep using -s 2 Repeat again with ./saltutil.py 5 init followed by ./dcbutil.py init ~/bin/tmp_0.xml -s 6 Link Selection must be on 13 Note Refer to this table if instructions are unclear as to what numbers you should be using.

Repeat this process starting with ./saltutil.py 1 init followed by ./dcbutil.py init ~/bin/tmp_0.xml -s 4 Link Selection must be on 21 now When incrementing tmp_*.xml keep using -s 4 Repeat again with ./saltutil.py 0 init followed by ./dcbutil.py init ~/bin/tmp_0.xml -s 5 Link Selection must be on 14 TFC Test Type ./saltutil.py [I2C] ser_src tfc replacing the [I2C] with 3 , 4 , and 5 if the DCB is in slot JD10 . Replace with 0 , 1 , 2 if the DCB is in slot JD11 Look in memory monitoring again and select links based on slot Same as SALT. JD10 gets links 22, 12, and 13. JD11 gets links 23, 21, and 14 The values in the table should be something similar to 01, 02, 04, or 08 repeating ADC Read Out If there is no MiniDAQ panel called GBT Client already open, open it by going back to the MiniDAQ UI (the one with \"Gedi\" in its title) and under LHCB Framework , click GBT Client .

The firmware loaded onto the LVRs by default does not allow for channels to be directly controlled. When power is connected the channels will come up in sequenced pairs (1-2, then 3-4, etc). It is therefore important that you only bring up Vin if you are okay with there being Vout. It is wise to first power up with the loads disconnected and verify the polarity and amplitude of the outputs. Beware doing this that if loads are disconnected from Vout but the sense lines remain hooked up the output will just jump to 5V. Channels should not be left at 5V output for a long time. There is a resistor providing 220 Ohm minimal load, which is rated for 0.125W, but would have to dissipate 0.11W. Therefore, channels with power but no CCM should be set up as per \"other unused channels\" below, such that the power through this resistor is negligible. Channel Sense lines If RJ45 connections to the remote sense are unavailable (broken) the regulators will fall back on a local sense mode and regulate the output voltage at their connector instead. The sense line inputs follow RJ45 conventions: Channels Pins CH1 & 5 1 & 2 CH2 & 6 4 & 5 CH3 & 7 4 & 5 CH4 & 8 7 & 8 Setting Up Monitor/Programmer This section deal with setting up the monitor/programmer for the LVR. To set up the programmer: Turn power off Connect jumpers between J22 pins 2 & 4 ( V_pump ) Connect jumpers between J22 pins 1 & 3 ( V_jtag ) Connect programmer to J17 . Turn power on Initiate the program sequence Move jumpers on J22 to connect pins 4 & 6 and pins 3 & 5 To set up the monitor: Connect Raspberry Pi leads to J18 . Note Leads must start at pin row 3-4, not 1-2. Turn on raspberry Pi and run code V_SENSE refers to the output feedback voltage from the CCM V_REGUL_OUT refers to full input voltage i_SENSE_MON refers to current through resistor ____ Fuse/Channel Configuration This section deals with which channels are being used. Ideally fuses should be installed only for the channels to be used. Unfused is the safest state for an unused channel. The input BBs are mislabeled: Label on fuse Channels F3-4 CH5 & 6 F1-2 CH7 & 8 F7-8 CH1 & 2 F5-6 CH3 & 4 Input voltage should be set above the UVL (Undervoltage lockout) setting for that fuse group. As presently configured (pre-slice test) 5.5V appears adequate for all configurations, but this is subject to further study Undervoltage lockout is configured via SW6A-SW6D (that is, one per fuse group). This circuit disables the associated channels if the input voltage falls below a threshold set by the switch. Within one SW4x, the four toggles form a 3-digit number LSB -> MSB , with the fourth toggle putting the channel in an always on state (override UVL). It is best to be at least 0.25V, preferably 0.5V above the actual drop-out voltage, otherwise a channel may appear to be on, but when it actually tries to start the natural drop in Vin from the abrupt increase in current demand by the regulator causes the UVL to trip, leading to a series of false-start hiccups rather than actual starts. Configuration of LVR LVR Configuration is done via the CCMs and the potentiometers P3 and P4, which should be set according to the CCMs to be installed as Vos [V] Vout [V] 1.775 2.5 1.546 1.5 1.483 1.225 P3 controls CH1-CH4, P4 controls CH5-CH8, and each group of four must use the same CCM Vout. Vos may be measured across TP9-TP10 for CH1-4, and TP14-15 for CH5-8. Normal versus Duty Cycle Mode For Low Duty Cycle Pulsed mode, we enable this via setting SW3-1 to OFF. It provides a pulse every ~3 seconds that appears to last for ~60ms. Normal mode (or continuous mode) provides continuous transmission of voltage. It is recommended that for operation periods greater than ~20 minutes to have the board on Duty Cycle Pulsed mode (30-45 min in extreme cases), whereas short operation periods can utilize continuous mode. This is to prevent overheating of 4913ADLHC regulator chips on LVR. Master/slave pairings Master slave pairs should ideally always be within a fuse group, and must follow ascending channel number. That is, CH1 is M and CH2 is S, or CH3 is M and CH4 is S, or CH5 is M and CH6 is S etc. In addition to the appropriate CCM type, the firmware must be notified which channels are M+S pairs, via SW4. The OFF setting of the switch corresponds to a M+S pair, while the ON state is the setting for two single masters SW4 switch Channels 1 CH1 & 2 2 CH3 & 4 3 CH5 & 6 4 CH7 & 8 Note When setting up master/slave CCM pairs, slave CCMs should always be on even numbered CCMs. Note In the current firmware, SW5 contains enables for CH1-4, CH5-8 and a global standby. To operate the regulator SW5 must be set as: (OFF, OFF, ON, OFF) Tom's notes on the configuration switches for the LVR, including master/slave and general enables. IMPORTANT THE CONVENTION HERE IS OPPOSITE WHAT YOU EXPECT BECAUSE THESE ARE SHORTING PULL-UPS. \"ON\" ON THE SWITCH IS LOGIC 0 AND \"OFF\" IS LOGIC 1. Also please note that the physical order is 3,2,4,5 and NOT 2,3,4,5. Note that LVR Configuration is done via the CCMs and the potentiometers P3 and P4, which should be set according to the CCMs to be installed as Vos [V] Vout [V] 1.775 2.5 1.546 1.5 1.483 1.225 P3 controls CH1-CH4, P4 controls CH5-CH8, and each group of four must use the same CCM Vout. Vos may be measured across TP9-TP10 for CH1-4, and TP14-15 for CH5-8. Overtemperature/Undervoltage Lockout The overtemperature lockout is configured by SW1. SW1 represents a binary number with switch 1 the LSB and switch 4 the MSB. Settings which have been explored in the lab are (in big endian, LSB -> MSB ) Binary setting LVR shuts off at [C] 0101 39 1101 30 1001 55 0001 70 The slice test could easily run at either of the last two. The undervoltage lockout is configured by SW6(A, B, C, D). We note the following configurations for each SW6#. Note that if 4 in SW6#[1, 2, 3, 4] is ON, this acts as a bypass for all other switches. We therefore only consider switcher 1-3: SW6 switcher 1-3 Undervoltage lockout at [V] 0,0,0 5.9 1,0,0 5.4 0,1,0 5.1 0,0,1 4.6 1,1,0 5.1 0,1,1 4.1 1,1,1 3.9 1,0,1 4.6","title":"LVR Configuration"},{"location":"lvr/lvr_config/lvr_config/#abstract","text":"The following serves as a guide for general LVR operation as well as LVR QA procedures.

Beware doing this that if loads are disconnected from Vout but the sense lines remain hooked up the output will just jump to 5V. Channels should not be left at 5V output for a long time. There is a resistor providing 220 Ohm minimal load, which is rated for 0.125W, but would have to dissipate 0.11W. Therefore, channels with power but no CCM should be set up as per \"other unused channels\" below, such that the power through this resistor is negligible.","title":"Abstract"},{"location":"lvr/lvr_config/lvr_config/#channel-sense-lines","text":"If RJ45 connections to the remote sense are unavailable (broken) the regulators will fall back on a local sense mode and regulate the output voltage at their connector instead.

This circuit disables the associated channels if the input voltage falls below a threshold set by the switch. Within one SW4x, the four toggles form a 3-digit number LSB -> MSB , with the fourth toggle putting the channel in an always on state (override UVL). It is best to be at least 0.25V, preferably 0.5V above the actual drop-out voltage, otherwise a channel may appear to be on, but when it actually tries to start the natural drop in Vin from the abrupt increase in current demand by the regulator causes the UVL to trip, leading to a series of false-start hiccups rather than actual starts.","title":"Fuse/Channel Configuration"},{"location":"lvr/lvr_config/lvr_config/#configuration-of-lvr","text":"LVR Configuration is done via the CCMs and the potentiometers P3 and P4, which should be set according to the CCMs to be installed as Vos [V] Vout [V] 1.775 2.5 1.546 1.5 1.483 1.225 P3 controls CH1-CH4, P4 controls CH5-CH8, and each group of four must use the same CCM Vout.

The silkscreen label applies to the adjacent TP2 . Fused power input breakout board silk screen circuit labels are incorrect. The LVR outputs should be connected to a benign load that can withstand having upwards of 7V output. (i.e. the LVR channel outputs follow the input power rail if the CCM is not populated and configured.) Extreme caution is needed when connecting test lead clips to the test points. The test points are rather fragile and easily pulled of the board. Care must be taken to avoid temporary unintended shorts from the high density of surrounding components, via's, and traces. When configuring the CCMs on the LVR, remember that CCM voltage types split down the middle of the LVR (i.e. CH1-4 must have the same CCM voltage, CH5-8 must have the same CCM voltage) Going down the board on one side, arrange CCMs as master, slave, master, slave, etc. The Master-Slave configurations require a jumper ON the LVR output breakout board that electrically connects the master and slave output rails together.

Place another DVM between TP8 (1.5V) and TP6 (GND) to monitor the 1.5N rail Note You can also use the LVR monitor for this section, looking at the Vin_FPGA_3V3 and Vin_FPGA_1V5 reading. Slowly increase the input voltage from the initial 1.6V to a max of 4.5V while monitoring the 3.3V and 1.5V rails to make sure they stay below the max values. Warning STOP IF VALUES BELOW ARE EXCEEDED to prevent damage. 1.5V x 110% = 1.65V 3.3V x 110% = 3.63V Tip It may be useful to let the rail approach the desired value, then turn down the setpoint to a value much below the current input voltage in order to find the plateau (max voltage where the rail 'sticks') more quickly Adjust P1 to obtain 1.5V on TP8 . Continue increasing the input voltage and similarly adjust P2 to obtain 3.3V on TP3 . Both the 3.3V and 1.5V rails should be correct now and no longer increase as input voltage goes up. \u03c3V should be 0.01 V or less if possible. Expected input current given by the supply at this point should be around 0.09A. If it is substantially more there may be an issue. If not using the LVR monitor, place a DVM between TP4 ( Vop_rail ) and TP7 (GND). Otherwise proceed. Slowly increase the input voltage to 7V until EITHER the Vop_rail stops increasing or hits 5.5V. (Note this is just the same thing as for the 1.5V and 3.3V, just now it's 5.5V). Adjust P5 whilst increasing the input voltage The Vop_rail will clamp at a maximum of 5.5V when properly adjusted. Warning IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE Vop_rail NOT EXCEED 5.5V !!!!

Verify all V_OUT channel values as shown on monitor go to ~0V. Set SW1 back to nominal [ OFF, OFF, OFF, ON ] Note The output voltages in each channel will be slightly higher than that of the CCM voltage. 25 CCMs output ~2.7V, 15 output ~1.7 V, 12 output ~1.4 V Output standby configuration.

The sense lines are mapped to the RJ45 as follows: Channels Pins RJ45 Connector CH1 1 & 2 Right (J10) CH2 (if 12/25A) 4 & 5 Right (J10) CH3 3 & 6 Right (J10) CH4 (if 12/25A) 7 & 8 Right (J10) CH5 1 & 2 Left (J16) CH6 (if 12/25A) 4 & 5 Left (J16) CH7 3 & 6 Left (J16) CH8 (if 12/25A) 7 & 8 Left (J16) Note Slave channels will not alter voltage when shorting those channels. They will only go to RAIL when shorting their respective master channels. SPI Communication test On the laptop's desktop, locate the \"SPI test\". Run this shortcut. The username and password are both 'spitest' The 4 bytes transmitted to the LVR are in the left column, the 4 received are on the right. You should see (possibly after 4-5 rounds of communication) that the message received from the LVR is the previous one that was sent. Finally, once communication is verified, connect the SPI_RESET line (floating green wire) to any GND test point on the LVR (the GND on the raspberry pi or the Rigol power supply also works in principle). The LVR should stop replying and you should read the response as all 00 00 00 00 until you allow the SPI_RESET to float once more. Example The following illustrates the kind of output you're looking for when communication is working: 04 04 04 04 03 03 03 03 05 05 05 05 04 04 04 04 06 06 06 06 05 05 05 05 07 07 07 07 06 06 06 06 If it is not already, set SW3 1 st switch to ON (takes regulator out of pulsed mode).","title":"LVR QA"},{"location":"minidaq/centos_tips/","text":"Downgrade a package If we want to downgrade a package to a previous highest version that is available in a remote repository, we can use the following command: sudo yum downgrade <package_name> Pinning a package to current version We use yum-plugin-versionlock .
